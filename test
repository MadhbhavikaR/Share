Let's start by building the class that will handle the workflow file upload and then dynamically apply the new workflow. This class will expose the REST endpoint for file upload and update the workflow configuration accordingly.

Here's how we can approach this step:

Step 1: Add Dependencies to build.gradle

For the workflow functionality, Kafka integration, and file handling, we will need the following dependencies in the build.gradle file:

plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '3.1.1'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.1.0'
    id 'java'
}

group = 'com.example'
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
sourceCompatibility = '17'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-activiti'
    implementation 'org.springframework.kafka:spring-kafka'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
    runtimeOnly 'com.h2database:h2'
    
    testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
    testImplementation 'org.springframework.kafka:spring-kafka-test'
}

spring-boot-starter-web: For creating REST endpoints.

spring-boot-starter-activiti: For managing workflows.

spring-kafka: For Kafka integration.

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: For database interactions (we will store configurations at the org/job/catalogue level).

h2database: For a simple in-memory database (you can change this to any other DB later).


Step 2: Implement File Upload Controller

We'll now build the class that handles the file upload:

WorkflowFileController.java

package com.example.workflow.controller;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/workflow")
public class WorkflowFileController {

    private static final String WORKFLOW_DIR = "/tmp/workflows/";
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public WorkflowFileController(KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate) {
        this.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;
    }

    @PostMapping("/upload")
    public ResponseEntity<String> uploadWorkflowFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
        try {
            // Ensure the directory exists
            Path workflowPath = Paths.get(WORKFLOW_DIR);
            if (!Files.exists(workflowPath)) {
                Files.createDirectories(workflowPath);
            }

            // Save the uploaded file to the directory
            String fileName = file.getOriginalFilename();
            Path filePath = workflowPath.resolve(fileName);
            Files.write(filePath, file.getBytes());

            // Send a message to Kafka that a new workflow has been uploaded
            kafkaTemplate.send("workflow-updates", "New workflow uploaded: " + fileName);

            // Return success response
            return new ResponseEntity<>("File uploaded successfully", HttpStatus.OK);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            return new ResponseEntity<>("File upload failed: " + e.getMessage(), HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. REST Endpoint:

POST /api/workflow/upload accepts a multipart file upload.

It saves the workflow file to a directory (/tmp/workflows/ for now, but you can change this).



2. Kafka Integration:

After the file is uploaded, a message is sent to a Kafka topic (workflow-updates), informing that a new workflow file has been uploaded.



3. Response Handling: The method returns a success message upon file upload or an error message if something goes wrong.



Step 3: Application Configuration

You'll need to configure Kafka and any other relevant properties in your application.properties or application.yml.

application.properties

spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=workflow-group
spring.kafka.template.default-topic=workflow-updates

Make sure that Kafka is running and the workflow-updates topic is created (you can use Kafka CLI tools to create the topic).

Next Steps:

1. Implement the service that will process the uploaded workflow file.


2. Configure how the new workflow will be applied to future jobs/catalogues.


3. Set up database configurations (e.g., org-level job configurations).



Let me know if this makes sense, and we can proceed with the next class or functionality!



========================================

Now that we have the file upload controller, the next step is to create a service that processes the uploaded workflow file and ensures it's applied to future jobs/catalogues.

We'll approach this by:

1. Processing the Uploaded Workflow File: When a new workflow is uploaded, this service will load the workflow definition and replace the current one.


2. Managing Workflow Configurations: This will involve persisting configurations for org/job/catalogue-level settings in the database.


3. Integrating with Activiti: Once the workflow file is uploaded, Activiti will be notified to use the new workflow for any upcoming jobs.



Let's first build the service responsible for managing the workflow.

Step 1: Create the Workflow Service

WorkflowService.java

package com.example.workflow.service;

import org.activiti.engine.RepositoryService;
import org.activiti.engine.repository.Deployment;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

@Service
public class WorkflowService {

    private final RepositoryService repositoryService;

    public WorkflowService(RepositoryService repositoryService) {
        this.repositoryService = repositoryService;
    }

    @Transactional
    public String deployWorkflow(File workflowFile) {
        try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(workflowFile)) {
            // Deploy the new workflow
            Deployment deployment = repositoryService.createDeployment()
                    .addInputStream(workflowFile.getName(), fileInputStream)
                    .deploy();

            return "Workflow deployed with ID: " + deployment.getId();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Failed to deploy workflow", e);
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. RepositoryService: This is provided by Activiti and is used to manage deployments. The uploaded workflow file is deployed through this service.


2. DeployWorkflow Method:

It accepts a File object (the uploaded workflow file).

The file is deployed to Activiti using the RepositoryService, which registers the workflow for future jobs.




Step 2: Update the Controller to Use WorkflowService

We will now modify the WorkflowFileController to use the WorkflowService for processing the uploaded workflow.

Updated WorkflowFileController.java

package com.example.workflow.controller;

import com.example.workflow.service.WorkflowService;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/workflow")
public class WorkflowFileController {

    private static final String WORKFLOW_DIR = "/tmp/workflows/";
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;
    private final WorkflowService workflowService;

    @Autowired
    public WorkflowFileController(KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate, WorkflowService workflowService) {
        this.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;
        this.workflowService = workflowService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/upload")
    public ResponseEntity<String> uploadWorkflowFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
        try {
            // Ensure the directory exists
            Path workflowPath = Paths.get(WORKFLOW_DIR);
            if (!Files.exists(workflowPath)) {
                Files.createDirectories(workflowPath);
            }

            // Save the uploaded file to the directory
            String fileName = file.getOriginalFilename();
            Path filePath = workflowPath.resolve(fileName);
            Files.write(filePath, file.getBytes());

            // Deploy the workflow using WorkflowService
            String deploymentResult = workflowService.deployWorkflow(filePath.toFile());

            // Send a message to Kafka that a new workflow has been uploaded
            kafkaTemplate.send("workflow-updates", "New workflow uploaded and deployed: " + fileName);

            // Return success response
            return new ResponseEntity<>(deploymentResult, HttpStatus.OK);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            return new ResponseEntity<>("File upload failed: " + e.getMessage(), HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. WorkflowService Integration:

The WorkflowService is injected into the controller.

After the file is uploaded, it's passed to the WorkflowService to deploy the new workflow.



2. Kafka Notification: A Kafka message is sent informing that the workflow has not only been uploaded but also deployed.



Step 3: Database Configuration for Workflow Storage

In future steps, we will implement a configuration layer in the database, allowing workflows to be associated with specific organizations, jobs, or catalogues.

We'll need to:

1. Set up JPA entities and repositories.


2. Persist workflow configurations at the organization/job level.



Next Steps:

Would you like to continue by setting up database storage (configurations for organizations or jobs), or should we focus on Kafka integration for workflow state updates?
